1. Introduction

Channel Shuffle can be used to create images from specified channels (red,
green, blue and alpha) from two images. It is written with the goals of being
lightweight, fast, easy to use and portable.

There are two parts to this application, first there is channel_shuffle,
which is a command line application that can be used independently. Then there
is channel_shuffle_gui, which is a graphical front end for channel_shuffle
created in Qt.

a. Generally potentially useful info

* When inputting images of different sizes without specifying the size of the
  output image, it uses the size of the largest input image. The smaller image
  is resized up to that size using nearest neighbour interpolation. Since there
  is no size setting in the GUI, it uses the size of the largest input image as
  the output size.

2. Instructions for channel_shuffle

channel_shuffle [input 1] [input 2 (optional)] [output] [flag/argument pairs (at least one)]

IMPRTANT NOTE: There are working examples in example.bat that you can study and
execute to see the application in action.


# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
a. Examples

- - - - - - - -
Example 1:
Takes the red and green channels from image1.tga and puts them into the green
and alpha channels of a new image called output1.tga. The rest of the channels
will default to black.

    channel_shuffle image1.tga output1.tga -g 1r -a 1g

- - - - - - - -
Example 2:
Takes the red, green and blue channels from image1.tga and puts them into the
red, green and blue channels of a new image called output2.tga, takes the red
channel of image2.tga and puts it into the alpha channel of output2.tga.

    channel_shuffle image1.tga image2.tga output2.tga -r 1r -g 1g -b 1b -a 2r

- - - - - - - -
Example 3:
Takes the red channel from image1.tga, inverts it, and puts it into the red
green and blue channels of output3.tga. The alpha channel will default to black.

    channel_shuffle image1.tga output3.tga -r 1ri -g 1ri -b 1ri

b. Supported formats

This application uses SOIL (Simple OpenGL Image Library)
http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html

Supported input formats:
    BMP - non-1bpp, non-RLE (from stb_image documentation)
    PNG - non-interlaced (from stb_image documentation)
    JPG - JPEG baseline (from stb_image documentation)
    TGA - greyscale or RGB or RGBA or indexed, uncompressed or RLE
    DDS - DXT1/2/3/4/5, uncompressed
    PSD - (from stb_image documentation)
    HDR - converted to LDR

Supported output formats:
    TGA - Uncompressed
    BMP - RGB, uncompressed
    DDS - DXT5


# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
c. Flags

-r - Targets red channel of the output image.
-g - Targets green channel of the output image.
-b - Targets blue channel of the output image.
-a - Targets alpha channel of the output image.


# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
d. Arguments

An argument is constructed by taking a number that represents what image to
take a channel from (1 or 2) and combining it with a letter that represents
which channel to take from that image (r, g, b or a).

Optionally an 'i' can be added after at the end of the argument to also invert
the channel in the resulting image.

1 - Refers to input image 1.
2 - Refers to input image 2.

r - Takes the red channel from the supplied input image.
g - Takes the green channel from the supplied input image.
b - Takes the blue channel from the supplied input image.
a - Takes the alpha channel from the supplied input image.

i - Inverts the supplied channel in the resulting image.

3. Instructions for channel_shuffle_gui

Click and drag an image from a folder to one of the input slots on the left
side to load them.

Press the radio buttons in the middle to decide what channels from the input
images should become what channel in the output image.

A faster way to set the output channels is to hover the input images to display
the different channels and then press 1, 2, 3 or 4 or R, G, B or A on the
keyboard to connect that channel to the red, green, blue or alpha channels in
the output image.

Click the buttons labeled R, G, B and A above the radio buttons to invert that
channel in the output image.

Use the drop down menu above the output image on the right to change the output
format.
* TGA format is 32 bit uncompressed.
* BMP throws away the alpha channel (due to lack of alpha support in that format).
* DDS is compressed with DXT5.

You can click and drag the right image to a folder on your computer to export
the image to that location with the name "untitled", this is the only way to
save the output to your hard drive. Drop it on one of the input slots to keep
shuffling with the output.

a. Potentially useful information for GUI version

* You can change the default images by replacing the images called image_1.tga
  and image_2.tga in the program folder, or remove them if you'd like to have
  no default images.
* You can replace no_image_preview.tga in the program folder to change what
  image is used when there is no image in an input slot. This situation happens
  if you try to load an incompatible image.
