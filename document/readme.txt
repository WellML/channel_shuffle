1. Introduction

This application can be used to create images from selected channels (red,
green, blue and alpha) from two images.

There are two parts to this application, first there is channel_shuffle,
which is a command line application with the above functionality. Then there's
channel_shuffle_gui, which is a graphical front end for channel_shuffle
created in Qt.


# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
a. Licenses
Both channel_shuffle and channel_shuffle_gui as well as their source code
are in the public domain.

2. Instructions for channel_shuffle

channel_shuffle [input 1] [input 2 (optional)] [output] [flag/argument pairs (at least one)]

IMPRTANT NOTE: There are working examples in example.bat that you can study and
execute to see the application in action.


# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
a. Examples

- - - - - - - -
Example 1:
Takes the red and green channels from image1.tga and puts them into the green
and alpha channels of a new image called output1.tga. The rest of the channels
will default to black.

    channel_shuffle image1.tga output1.tga -g 1r -a 1g

- - - - - - - -
Example 2:
Takes the red, green and blue channels from image1.tga and puts them into the
red, green and blue channels of a new image called output2.tga, takes the red
channel of image2.tga and puts it into the alpha channel of output2.tga.

    channel_shuffle image1.tga image2.tga output2.tga -r 1r -g 1g -b 1b -a 2r

- - - - - - - -
Example 3:
Takes the red channel from image1.tga, inverts it, and puts it into the red
green and blue channels of output3.tga. The alpha channel will default to black.

    channel_shuffle image1.tga output3.tga -r 1ri -g 1ri -b 1ri

b. Supported formats

This application uses SOIL (Simple OpenGL Image Library)
http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html

Supported input formats:
    BMP - non-1bpp, non-RLE (from stb_image documentation)
    PNG - non-interlaced (from stb_image documentation)
    JPG - JPEG baseline (from stb_image documentation)
    TGA - greyscale or RGB or RGBA or indexed, uncompressed or RLE
    DDS - DXT1/2/3/4/5, uncompressed
    PSD - (from stb_image documentation)
    HDR - converted to LDR

Supported output formats:
    TGA - Uncompressed
    BMP - RGB, uncompressed
    DDS - DXT5


# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
c. Flags

-r - Targets red channel of the output image.
-g - Targets green channel of the output image.
-b - Targets blue channel of the output image.
-a - Targets alpha channel of the output image.


# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
d. Arguments

An argument is constructed by taking a number that represents what image to
take a channel from (1 or 2) and combining it with a letter that represents
which channel to take from that image (r, g, b or a).

Optionally an 'i' can be added after at the end of the argument to also invert
the channel in the resulting image.

1 - Refers to input image 1.
2 - Refers to input image 2.

r - Takes the red channel from the supplied input image.
g - Takes the green channel from the supplied input image.
b - Takes the blue channel from the supplied input image.
a - Takes the alpha channel from the supplied input image.

i - Inverts the supplied channel in the resulting image.
